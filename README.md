#DevCon 2016 REST API Workshop

The purpose of this project is to allow participants in the REST API workshop at DevCon 2016 in Vegas to follow along with the presentation. Attendees can watch the screen, follow the code as we work through it, or actually build the project as we build it. It is completely up to the individual attendee.

##Prerequisites
If the attendee wishes to code along with us, the following things are assumed:
*	User has installed and started the latest <a href="https://community.blackboard.com/docs/DOC-1649" target="_blank">Developer Virtual Machine</a>.
*	User has installed and configured <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank">GIT</a>.
*	User has cloned this repository to their local working directory.
* 	User has Java 8 installed and configured to JAVA_HOME.
* 	User has registered for an account on the <a href="https://developer.blackboard.com" target="_blank">Developer Portal</a>.	

##Caveats
*	This has not been tested on Windows. It should work, but may require additional configuration steps.
